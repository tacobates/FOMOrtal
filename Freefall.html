<h1>Freefall - The Grave Slide</h1>
<!--heartbeat background-->

<!--chorus, deep/pianisimo to higher/forte with screaming-->
<p>
  Some people call it a race,
  but that implies our consent.<br/>
  It’s a freefall through space,
  HOW MANY SECONDS ARE SPENT?!?
</p>

<!--sudden drop to slow jam.  Each line ends with sostenuto + vocal pause-->
<p>
  Just dancing as I’m fallin'<br/>
  S’a way to pass the time<br/>
  The grave she is a callin’<br/>
  Pretend it s’all just fine<br/> <!--TODO: better lyric ???-->

<h3>Unformed Ideas:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Less height = less awe and child-like wonder</li>
  <li>“Grave Slide” is a secondary title describing the dance we encourage people to do as they freefall</li>
  <li>The picture’s gettin’ clearer = closer to the ground so you can see it better</li>
  <li>Low Res Perspective - We all start with an eagle eye view, but it's blurry</li>
  <li>Some people are so scared they don't open their eyes and see the view</li>
</ul>
