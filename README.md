# FOMOrtal
FOMOrtal (pronounced "Faux Mortal") is a programmer and artist who believes form should follow function in art as it does in software.  
As such, meaning is valued above all else.  
A little-known ditty with profound lyrical depth is still a success.  
A catchy tune propagating vapidity to increasingly mindless consumers is a failure regardless of profit.  
No decoration, no matter how profitable, matters as much as the passionate scribbles of an undiscovered Picasso.  

He's also a ham-fisted narcissist convinced his message is somehow unique, despite all evidence to the contrary.
